export const bio = 'I am a self taught web developer, professional musician and jack of all trades. I started studying html, css then javascript in the summer of 2020, being unable to perform live as a professional musician due to government restrictions. I quickly moved on to learning React and building my own projects. I am passionate about clean code and constantly improving my designs. My background as a musician means I am naturally inclined to look at things from a different standpoint and a real eye for esthetics.'
